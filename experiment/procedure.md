1. Firstly learn everything from the 'Demo' section.
2. Then, test your understanding about Latch and Flip Flops in the 'Pretest' section.
3. Then in the 'Practice' section in the task-1 "RS Flip-Flop", make RS Flip-Flop using logic gates and test it with different inputs.
4. Then, in the task-2 "D Flip-Flop", implement a D flip-flop using RS Flip-Flop.
5. After that, in task-3 "JK Flip-Flop" make a JK Flip-Flop using logic gates and test it with different inputs.
6. Then, in the task-4 "T Flip-Flop", implement a T flip-flop using JK Flip-Flop.
7. Finally, test your understanding of the experiment in the 'Posttest' section.
